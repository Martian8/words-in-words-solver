Words in words is a game where a word is chosen, and using letters from the chosen word, you make new words

for example with the word dinner

I can get:

I, in, inn, inner, id, ire, din, dine, diner, dire, den, en, end, rid, red, rind, rend, rend, ride, rein, nerd, nine

This Program can get:

de, den, deni, die, din, dine, diner, dire, ed, en, end, endrin, er, ern, i, id, in, inn, inned, inner, ire, ired, ne, nerd, nide, nine, niner, re, red, rei, rein, rend, renin, rid, ride, rin, rind

Obviously with longer words this difference becomes much more apparent
